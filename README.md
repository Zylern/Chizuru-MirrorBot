## Setting up things

If you're on Heroku, just add these in the Environmental Variables
or if you're Locally hosting, create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add all the variables there.
An example of `.env` file:

```sh
API_ID=452525
API_HASH=esx576f8738x883f3sfzx83
BOT_TOKEN=55838383:yourtbottokenhere
BIN_CHANNEL=-100
PORT=8080
FQDN=yourserverip
HAS_SSL=False
```

### Mandatory Vars

`API_ID` : Goto [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) to obtain this.

`API_HASH` : Goto [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) to obtain this.

`BOT_TOKEN` : Get the bot token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.dog/BotFather)

`BIN_CHANNEL` : Create a new channel (private/public), add [@missrose_bot](https://telegram.dog/MissRose_bot) as admin to the channel and type /id. Now copy paste the ID into this field.


### Optional Vars

`SLEEP_THRESHOLD` : Set a sleep threshold for flood wait exceptions happening globally in this telegram bot instance, below which any request that raises a flood wait will be automatically invoked again after sleeping for the required amount of time. Flood wait exceptions requiring higher waiting times will be raised. Defaults to 60 seconds.

`WORKERS` : Number of maximum concurrent workers for handling incoming updates. Defaults to `3`

`PORT` : The port that you want your webapp to be listened to. Defaults to `8080`

`WEB_SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS` : Your server bind adress. Defauls to `0.0.0.0`

`NO_PORT` : (can be either `True` or `False`) If you don't want your port to be displayed. You should point your `PORT` to `80` (http) or `443` (https) for the links to work. Ignore this if you're on Heroku.

`FQDN` :  A Fully Qualified Domain Name if present. Defaults to `WEB_SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS`

`HAS_SSL` : (can be either `True` or `False`) If you want the generated links in https format.
